The video series serves as a blueprint for this project. Mr.Sharick was my high school AP Computer Science teacher, and I was forced to watch those videos
for class homework grades. Back then, I had little interest in learning how to play chess and was not particularly impressed by the art of computer science.  However, now, as an 
undergrad at a well-known tech school, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to Mr.Sharick for his teaching by revising and continuing this project on my own.
